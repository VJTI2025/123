# **Experiment 4: Introduction to Docker**

---

### **Objective:**

To learn the basics of Docker, including installing Docker, pulling images, running containers, and hosting a simple web server.

---

### **Tools Required:**

* Docker Desktop
* Docker Hub account
* Internet connection
* Command-line terminal

---

### **Theory (Short & Simple):**

* **Docker** is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications with all dependencies into containers.
* A **container** is a lightweight, isolated environment that runs applications consistently across different systems.
* **Docker Images** are blueprints for creating containers.
* **Docker Hub** is an online registry for sharing Docker images.

---

### **Procedure:**

#### **Step 1: Install and Verify Docker**

```bash
winget install docker.dockerDesktop     # Install Docker
docker --version                        # Verify installation
```

---

#### **Step 2: Open Docker Desktop**

* Launch Docker Desktop and **login or sign up** with your Docker Hub account.

---

#### **Step 3: Pull an Operating System Image**

```bash
docker pull ubuntu
```

---

#### **Step 4: Run a Docker Container and Execute Commands**

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu
ls
pwd
echo "Hello from Docker Container"
exit
```

---

#### **Step 5: List Downloaded Images**

```bash
docker images
```

---

#### **Step 6: Run a Web Server Container (NGINX)**

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

Then open your browser and visit:
ðŸ‘‰ **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**
You should see the **NGINX welcome page**.

---

#### **Step 7: Stop and Remove the Container**

```bash
docker ps                  # List running containers
docker stop <container_id> # Stop container
docker rm <container_id>   # Remove container
```

---

### **Result / Observation:**

Successfully installed Docker, pulled Ubuntu and NGINX images, and launched containers. Verified Docker functionality by interacting with containers and hosting a simple web server.
