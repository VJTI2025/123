# **Experiment 3: Introduction to Shell Scripting**

---

### **Objective:**

To understand the basics of shell scripting and automate simple tasks using Bash scripts.

---

### **Tools Required:**

* Linux terminal / AWS CloudShell
* Text editor (`nano`, `vim`, or VS Code)

---

### **Theory (Short & Simple):**

* **Shell scripting** is used to automate repetitive command-line tasks.
* A **shell script** is a text file containing a series of commands that the shell can execute.
* Common uses: backups, monitoring, automation, and system setup.
* Every shell script starts with a **shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)** to specify the shell interpreter.

---

## **Examples:**

---

### **Example 1: Hello World Script**

```bash
# Create a new file
nano hello.sh
```

**Write the script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, Welcome to Shell Scripting!"
```

**Save and exit:** `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`
**Make executable:**

```bash
chmod +x hello.sh
```

**Run:**

```bash
./hello.sh
```

---

### **Example 2: Simple Calculator**

```bash
nano calculator.sh
```

**Add code:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter two numbers:"
read a
read b
echo "Sum = $(($a + $b))"
```

**Make executable and run:**

```bash
chmod +x calculator.sh
./calculator.sh
```

---

### **Example 3: File Backup Script**

```bash
nano backup.sh
```

**Add code:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cp myfile.txt myfile_backup.txt
echo "Backup created!"
```

**Test the script:**

```bash
touch myfile.txt
chmod +x backup.sh
./backup.sh
```

---

### **Result:**

Successfully created and executed basic shell scripts for printing output, performing arithmetic, and creating file backups.
