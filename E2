# **Experiment 2: Introduction to Git and GitHub**

---

### **Objective:**

* Learn basic Git commands.
* Understand how to create and push code to GitHub.

---

### **Tools Required:**

* Git installed on your system
* GitHub account
* Code editor (e.g., VS Code)

---

### **Theory:**

1. **Git** is a distributed version control system.
2. It tracks changes in files and maintains the projectâ€™s complete history.
3. Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.
4. **GitHub** is an online hosting platform built on Git.
5. It provides **cloud storage** for Git repositories.
6. GitHub includes collaboration features like **pull requests**, **issues**, and **version tracking**.
7. Git works locally, while GitHub helps in **team collaboration and remote sharing**.
8. Both **open-source** and **private** projects can be managed on GitHub.

### **Procedure:**

#### **Step 1: Install Git**

```bash
winget install git.git
```

#### **Step 2: Initialize a Local Git Repository**

```bash
git init
```

#### **Step 3: Create a File**

Create a new file (e.g., `hello.txt`) and add some text inside it.

#### **Step 4: Stage the File**

```bash
git add .
```

#### **Step 5: Commit the File**

```bash
git commit -m "First commit"
```

#### **Step 6: Create a GitHub Repository**

* Log in to **GitHub** â†’ Click **New Repository**.
* Name your repo and click **Create Repository**.
* Copy the **HTTPS URL** of the repo.

#### **Step 7: Link Local Repo to GitHub**

```bash
git remote add origin <your_repo_url>
```

#### **Step 8: Push Code to GitHub**

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

---

### **Conclusion:**

Git efficiently manages code versions locally, and GitHub extends it by providing cloud-based storage and collaboration tools for teamwork and version control.
