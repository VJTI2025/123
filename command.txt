Hereâ€™s a short **technical theory on Nmap** â€” concise and clear for reports or viva prep ðŸ‘‡

### **Nmap â€“ Network Mapper**

**Nmap (Network Mapper)** is an open-source network scanning and security auditing tool used to discover hosts, services, and vulnerabilities on a network. It helps administrators and penetration testers understand the networkâ€™s structure and detect potential security risks.

**Key Functions:**

* **Host Discovery:** Identifies active devices on a network using ICMP, ARP, or TCP/UDP probes.
* **Port Scanning:** Determines open, closed, or filtered ports on a target system.
* **Service & Version Detection:** Detects running services and their versions using probe responses.
* **OS Detection:** Estimates the operating system based on packet behavior and response signatures.
* **Scriptable Scanning (NSE):** Uses the **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)** to automate vulnerability detection and configuration audits.

**Common Commands:**

* `nmap <target>` â€“ Basic scan
* `nmap -sS <target>` â€“ Stealth SYN scan
* `nmap -O <target>` â€“ OS detection
* `nmap -sV <target>` â€“ Service version detection
* `nmap -A <target>` â€“ Aggressive scan (OS + version + scripts)

**Use Cases:**

* Network inventory and topology mapping
* Security assessment and vulnerability scanning
* Firewall and intrusion detection testing

**Output Formats:** Nmap supports text, XML, and HTML output for easy analysis and reporting.

Would you like me to make this version even **shorter (around 4â€“5 lines)** for a report summary section?
