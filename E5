# **Experiment 5: System Monitoring and Networking Commands in Linux**

---

### **Objective:**

To learn and use basic system monitoring and network utility commands in Linux.

---

### **Tools Required:**

* Linux terminal (Ubuntu / Amazon Linux / CloudShell)
* Internet connection

---

### **Theory (Short & Simple):**

* **System monitoring commands** help check CPU, memory, and process usage.
* **Network commands** help analyze open ports, network connections, and routing tables.
* These tools are essential for system administration, troubleshooting, and performance monitoring.

---

### **Procedure:**

#### **1. Install htop (System Monitor)**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install htop -y
```

**Run htop:**

```bash
htop
```

* Displays real-time system metrics like CPU, memory usage, and active processes.

---

#### **2. List All Open Ports**

```bash
netstat -tuln
```

* Shows all active **TCP/UDP** ports and listening addresses.

---

#### **3. Show Listening Services with Process IDs**

```bash
netstat -tulpn
```

* Displays which services or processes are using specific ports.

---

#### **4. Display All Active Network Connections**

```bash
netstat -ant
```

* Lists all **active TCP connections** and their states.

---

#### **5. View the System Routing Table**

```bash
netstat -r
```

* Shows the kernelâ€™s **IP routing table** â€” useful for diagnosing network issues.

---

### **Result / Observation:**

Successfully executed system monitoring and networking commands (`htop`, `netstat`) to observe CPU usage, open ports, and routing information in a Linux environment.
